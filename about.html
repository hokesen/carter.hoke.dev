  <h1>About Carter</h1>
  <p>Born and raised in Washington state, adventure and ambition guide my path.</p>
  <h2>A Pacific Northwest Developer and Adventurer</h2>
  <p>Biking, hiking, climbing, and skiing are some of my favorite outdoor activities!</p>
  <p>Performing vocals and guitar allows me to grow, learn, and push myself outside my comfort zone!</p>
  <p>And of course playing games allows me to immerse myself in new, and familiar worlds, while experiencing handcrafted art and that others have dedicated themselves to shaping and creating, for folks like you and me!</p>
