  <h1>About Carter</h1>
  <p>Born and raised in Washington state, adventure and ambition guide my path.</p>
  <h2>A Pacific Northwest Designer and Adventurer</h2>
  <p>Biking, hiking, climbing, and skiing keep me grounded in challenge, pacing, and environmental awareness.</p>
  <p>Performing vocals and guitar continues to shape how I think about rhythm, tone, and emotional build.</p>
  <p>Games bring those influences together through crafted spaces, clear intent, and memorable player moments.</p>
