  <h1>Barton</h1>
  <h2>What Is Barton?</h2>
  <p class="section-summary">A first-person sci-fi puzzle adventure built in Unreal Engine 5, centered on cooperation with an AI companion through open dialogue and shared gameplay goals.</p>
  <p>A sci-fi themed puzzle adventure where the player builds a relationship with a companion bot named Barton.</p>
  <p>Barton's dialogue is powered by a large language model (ChatGPT 4o mini). Through prompts and player inputs, you and Barton can discuss objectives, make decisions together, and shape the tone of the journey.</p>
  <p>Built by a 21-person academic team in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
  <p>Generative AI was only used for text responses. All design, art, programming, and production work was created by our team, Wise Reply.</p>

      <h2>My Roles</h2>
      <p class="section-summary">I served as the sole level designer and a qualitative user researcher, owning spatial flow while using weekly player feedback to refine readability and pacing.</p>
      <h3>Sole Level Designer</h3>
      <p>As the only level designer on the project, I owned the layout, pacing, and puzzle framing for both interior and exterior spaces.</p>
      <p>I coordinated closely with design and tech teammates so level changes would support Barton’s AI behavior, puzzle readability, and traversal reliability.</p>
      <p>I also partnered with environment artists at both macro and micro scales to align composition, architecture, and gameplay beats.</p>
      <h3>Qualitative User Researcher</h3>
      <p>I ran weekly playtests using participant observation and semi-structured interviews, primarily with convenience-sampled peers and friends.</p>
      <p>These sessions gave me recurring insight into navigation clarity, puzzle comprehension, and emotional tone across the player journey.</p>
      <p>I also ran two focused studies: one on readability and flow over time, and one comparing briefed players versus blind players.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The briefed-vs-blind study showed no significant differences in key outcomes.</p>
      <p>The flow-over-time study showed April 2025 playtesters had clearer goals and easier navigation than March 2025 playtesters.</p>

      <h2>Production Details</h2>
      <p class="section-summary">Barton was developed across two academic semesters, with cross-discipline collaboration focused on AI affordances, puzzle progression, and environmental readability.</p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>Barton was developed over roughly 30 weeks in Unreal Engine 5 by a team of 20: 5 designers, 5 programmers, 9 artists, and 1 sound designer.</p>
      <p>The project goal was to create a narrative puzzle journey where players build rapport with Barton while navigating a desolate research facility.</p>
      <p>The experience prioritized cooperation and emotional connection over high mechanical difficulty.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
      <p>I worked with designers to define Barton’s affordances, interaction vocabulary, and puzzle-context behavior.</p>
      <p>I partnered with programmers and technical designers to ensure every intended player solution remained stable as levels evolved.</p>
      <p>I also collaborated closely with environment art to preserve gameplay clarity while integrating final art assets.</p>
