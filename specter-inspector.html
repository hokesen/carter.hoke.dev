      <h2>My Roles</h2>
      <p class="section-summary">I worked as level designer and design lead, owning encounter flow, player readability, and design cohesion across gameplay systems.</p>
      <h3>Level Designer</h3>
      <p>My primary responsibility was to ensure mechanics and systems were presented in spaces that made their purpose, risk, and payoff immediately legible to players.</p>
      <p>I designed encounter pacing around tool friction, enemy variety, and constrained visibility to keep tension high without becoming unfair.</p>
      <h3>Design Lead</h3>
      <p>I aligned design direction with our game pillars, managed designer priorities, and coordinated implementation with engineering.</p>
      <p>I also handled recurring playtesting and user research reporting to ensure iteration decisions were evidence-backed.</p>
      <h3>Additional Contributions</h3>
      <p>I composed the game’s original soundtrack (menu, gameplay, and trailer-associated track).</p>

    <section class="panel section-center-headings" id="process">
      <h2>Level Design Process</h2>
      <p class="section-summary">The process moved from Unity prototyping to custom-engine implementation, with repeated adjustments to pacing, navigation clarity, and challenge curves.</p>
      <h3>Prototype Learning</h3>
      <p>Early Unity prototypes established that complex mazes produced frustration, while broader, more directed spaces felt clearer and more engaging under window-limited visibility.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Flow Restructure</h3>
      <p>The original single gauntlet level created uneven stress and pacing. I restructured the game into three modules to better onboard mechanics and escalate tension in a controlled arc.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Inspector Training: movement and baseline interactions.</li>
        <li>E.M.F. Training: specter detection and low-risk encounters.</li>
        <li>E.M.P. Training: higher-intensity scenarios and climax.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="panel section-center-headings" id="production">
      <h2>Production & Teaming</h2>
      <p class="section-summary">A two-semester schedule with a custom engine required close coupling between design and engineering from prototype parity through serialized content integration.</p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>Five programmers built the engine while three designers developed and iterated gameplay in parallel. The final game shipped with roughly 13 minutes of structured gameplay.</p>
      <h3>Engine Integration</h3>
      <p>We exported tilemaps, UI elements, enemies, and content data from Unity into our engine through JSON-based serialization.</p>
      <p>My implementation work focused on geometry correction, collision tuning, encounter reliability, and continuous regression playtesting.</p>

      <h2>Steam Polish & Release</h2>
      <p class="section-summary">After academic submission, we resumed development in summer 2025 for release polish, store assets, and final platform delivery.</p>
      <p>Following a development pause, I helped rally a small strike team to prepare the Steam launch build.</p>
      <p>Final work included UI updates, bug fixes, trailer production, and full Steam page asset creation.</p>
      <p>Specter Inspector released on August 15, 2025.</p>
